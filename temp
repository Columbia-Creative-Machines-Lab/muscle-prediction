A key challenge in soft robotics is to develop self-contained electrically driven soft actuators with high strain density. We attempt to model the behavior of a unique self-contained soft robust composite material combining the elastic properties of a polymeric matrix and the extreme volume change accompanying liquid-vapor transition, with the intent of measuring and predicting synthetic muscle wear and force during usage.
